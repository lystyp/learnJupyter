# TechLabs_Data_Science_Exam
Final exam for our TechLabs Barcelona batch in 2020ðŸŒ´.

# Why exam?
In order to assess your progress, we have prepared a challenge for you. Now, the main reason for having this is that we can't assess your progress solely based on the analytical tools we have since those are easy to cheat on. Moreover, this year some of our projects will be of professional nature. We are currently finalizing some of the contracts and are looking for capable people to deliver.

# Procedure of the exam:
1. Please download all the documents to your computer.
2. Answer all the required questions within the jupyter notebook (Don't forget to insert your name in the jupyter notebook).
3. Upload all documents on your github account.
4. Include the link of your github repository in the typeform.
